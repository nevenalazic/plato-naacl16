\section{Single-link model}
\label{sec:maxsum}

To motivate our modeling choices of using multi-focal attention and decomposed inference, we additionally consider a simple baseline model with single-focus attention and global inference. In this approach, which we name \emph{single link}, each mention $i$ attends to exactly one other mention that maximizes the pairwise relation score. The corresponding objective can be written as
\begin{align}
g^{SL}({\bf y}) &= \sum_i \bigg( s_i(y_i) + \max_{ j | j \neq i} s_{ij}(y_i, y_j) \bigg).
\end{align}

While exact inference in this model remains intractable, we can find approximate solutions using max-sum belief propagation \cite{Kschischang2001}. 
As a reminder, max-sum is an iterative algorithm for MAP inference which can be described in terms of messages sent from model factors $g_a({\bf y}_a)$ to each of their variables $y \in {\bf y}_a$. At convergence, each variable is assigned to the value that maximizes \emph{belief} $b(y)$, defined as the sum of incoming messages. The message updates have the following form:
\begin{align}
\mu_{g_a \rightarrow Y}(y) =& \max_{ {\bf y}_a \setminus y } \bigg[ g_a({\bf y}_a) + \sum_{j \neq i} q_j^{\setminus a}(y_j)\bigg]
\label{eq:damping}
\end{align}
\noindent where $q_j^{\setminus a}(y_j)$ is the sum of all messages to $y_j$ except the one from factor $g_a$. 
While the single-link model contains global factors $\max_{ j | j \neq i} s_{ij}(y_i, y_j)$ over $n$ variables, computing the messages from these factors is tractable and requires sorting.
