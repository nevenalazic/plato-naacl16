\section{Definitions and notation}
\label{sec:notation}

We are given a document with $n$ mentions, where each mention $i$ has a set of $n_i$ candidate entities $\mathcal{C}_i = \{c_{i,1}, ..., c_{i,n_i}\}$. The goal is to assign a label $y_i \in \mathcal{C}_i$ to each mention.

Similarly to previous work, our approach to disambiguation relies on local and pairwise candidate scores. We denote the local score for mention $i$ by $s_i(y_i)$; this score is based only on local evidence, such as the mention phrase and surrounding textual features. The pairwise score for mentions $i$, $j$ is denoted by $s_{ij}(y_i, y_j)$,  and it is based on the relatedness of the two candidates. In Sections \ref{sec:score_param} and \ref{sec:learning} we discuss how these scores may be parameterized and learned.  Many systems that exploit coherence \cite{Cucerzan07,Milne2008,KulkarniSRC09} simply hardwire pairwise scores.

%In the \emph{single link} model, we compute these scores deterministically and use them as fixed model inputs. In the \emph{attention} model, we parameterize the scores and learn them using a labeled dataset.

Coherence models typically attempt to maximize a {\em global} objective function that assigns a score to each complete labeling ${\bf y} = (y_1,\ldots, y_n)$, given the local and pairwise scores. An example of such a function is the sum of all singleton and pairwise scores for the label:
 %A common example of such a function $g(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ is:
\be
g({\bf y}) = \sum_i s_i(y_i) + \sum_i \sum_{j :  j \neq i} s_{ij}(y_i,y_j).
\label{eq:global_obj}
\ee 
One disadvantage of this approach is that maximizing $g$ corresponds to finding the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) assignment of a general pairwise Markov random field, and is hence
NP hard for the general case \cite{wainwright2008graphical}. Another limitation, as we discuss later, is that it sums information across all entities and can introduce noise in the process \todo{too vague?}. In this paper we explore alternative optimization objectives that address both these issues.
