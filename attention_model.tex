\section{Model Definition}
Assume we have $n$ mentions we wish to disambiguate. The $i^{th}$ mention will have $n_i$ candidates and we denote those by $c_1,\ldots, c_{n_i}$. The goal 
of the entity linking model is to assign a label $y_i\in \{c_1,\ldots, c_{n_i}\}$ to each mention.



The label for the $i^{th}$ mention will be denoted by $y_i$. 


Denote the candidate
disambiguations for mention $i$ by $y_i \in \{1,\ldots, n_i\}$ where $n_i$ is the number of candidates for this mention.
