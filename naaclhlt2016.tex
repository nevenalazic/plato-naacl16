\begin{abstract}
Entity resolution (ER) is the task of linking mentions of entities in text to their corresponding records in a knowledge base. Coherence models for ER jointly disambiguate all mentions in the document, and encourage a solution in which entities are related to each other. A common approach is to aggregate information for a candidate by considering relations to all other entities. We argue that this may dilute evidence for non-salient entities (with few relations), in addition to possibly being computationally infeasible for large documents. Instead, we propose an attention mechanism for coherence which selects a few relevant relations for each candidate. Our approach enjoys tractable inference and relies on a novel differentiable attention function which generalizes softmax. 
Applying our approach to the output of an existing system improves its performance to beat the state-of-the-art on three standard benchmarks: CoNLL, TAC KBP 2011, and TAC KBP 2012.

\section{Discussion and conclusion}
We have described two new approaches to modeling coherence for NERD. While most existing systems consider all relations in the document to assign a coherence score to a candidate, we use a novel attention mechanism to select the most relevant relations. Our experimental results support \hl{do they?} the premise that the inclusion of all relations can hurt performance. Our models improve the performance of a baseline system on three evaluation benchmarks, and the \emph{soft attention} coherence model achieves state-of-the-art results on the TAC KBP tasks \hl{or does it?}
