\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Entity resolution is the task of linking each mention of an entity in text to the corresponding record in a knowledge base (KB). Coherence models for entity resolution encourage all referring expressions in a document to resolve to entities that are related in the KB. Such models often consider the relations between a candidate entity and all other entities in the document, which may dilute the evidence for non-salient entities. In this work, we explore attention-like mechanisms for coherence that focus on a small set of most relevant relations for each candidate.
 Applying our approach to the output of an existing system improves its performance on three (out of three) benchmarks, yielding state-of-the-art results on the TAC KBP 2011 and 2012 tasks.

\section{Discussion and conclusion}

We have described a simple new graph-based approach to coherence, where each candidate can have at most one relation to another candidate in the solution subgraph. Our approach in effect maximizes over relation scores rather than averaging, which ensures that the scores are not diluted. Compared to the recently popular PageRank methods, our model can only exploit one-hop links. \hl{TODO: more discussion}
